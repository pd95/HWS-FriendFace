#  FriendFace

This repository shows my implementation of "FriendFace" which is part of the ["100 Days of SwiftUI"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course by Paul Hudson.

The state as implemented on day 60 and which is part of the [challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/5/3/challenge) can be found in the [initial commit](https://github.com/pd95/HWS-FriendFace/commits/master).

The later commits represent my implementation of [day 61: time for Core Data](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/61).
